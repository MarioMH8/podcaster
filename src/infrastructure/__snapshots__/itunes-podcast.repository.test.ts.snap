While we like moving at 33 RPM, the rest of the world rushed and went to digital. Not only did vinyl refuse to die but demand is at its highest since at least 1991. It's a good thing Dem Vinyl Boyz saved all their records from back in the day. Because, now we have the biggest collection of 12-inch records on the radio.  Dem Vinyl Boyz love the joy of sliding a classic album out of its cover; the crackle of a needle just dropped into a groove; the careful way to pick up and flip a record when a side ends. On the podcast each week we feature a different piece of music history on vinyl record. Dem Vinyl Boyz experience the album front and back, giving you commentary and music facts along the way. Put your ear buds in and let us take you on a musically journey listening to the greatest music of all time and the history of how it became legendary. Dem Vinyl Boyz! Respect The Technique",

    "description": "You know the myths. You’ve seen the biopics. But if you’re the kind of music fan who craves the rest of the story—the stuff they buried or cleaned up for streaming and theaters—this is your podcast. DISGRACELAND is the award-winning show that reveals the deeply human, highly dramatic, true crime–fueled chaos behind legendary musicians like Amy Winehouse, Jerry Lee Lewis, Sean “Diddy” Combs, the Grateful Dead, Blondie, and more. While we dig into the dark side, we do so with reverence for the artists—and an understanding of the extreme highs, lows, and personal costs that come with fame and making great art. This is music history like you’ve never heard it—edge-of-your-seat stories exploding with drama and the kind of information that’ll make you dangerous at dinner parties.

New, fully scripted and sound-designed episodes drop every Tuesday. On Thursdays, we hand the mic to you—and feature listener voicemails, texts, and emails in our interactive bonus episodes. And on Fridays, we revisit the wildest stories from our 250+ episode archive with “Rewind” drops that’ll transport you back into music history’s most entertaining moments.

DISGRACELAND is not a journalistic podcast—it’s an entertainment podcast inspired by true events. Certain dialogue and scenes are occasionally fictionalized for dramatic effect, as is common in scripted entertainment based on real stories. Sources and credits for each episode are available at www.disgracelandpod.com.

    "description": "13: A Taylor Swift Fan Podcast is a deep dive into everything Taylor Swift, her extensive discography, and all of her accomplishments. She is literally The Man of the music industry, after all.



Join Nick Adams, Ana Szabo, Amy Nichols and Lacey Gee every Tuesday as they break down a Taylor Swift song (TV only, of course, depending on which era we are currently in... What Era are we even in anyway?) and answer questions such as... Who was the inspiration behind that song? What connection ties this song to previous ones? Which bridge is our favorite to cross? How many Easter eggs have we yet to uncover? What does Taylor Swift put on her charcuterie boards? What does she smell like?



And most importantly, what every Swiftie really wants to know…. What’s next?!



But like a good Mastermind taught us, always be on the lookout! Be sure to subscribe to 13: A Taylor Swift Fan Podcast so you’ll be the first to know anytime we drop an emergency SwifTea episode. We can be a bit chaotic when the SwifTea is piping hot.
